# UFO

## Overview:
In this project, we are filtering several criteria in order to assist in the narrowing of tables for UFO sightings for Dana. 

## Results:
The webpage is fairly easy to navigate.  Simply maneuver to bottom left of the page and begin adding whatever criteria you would like in the search bars.

If someone wanted to see what UFO sightngs there had been in the city Fresno they would simply type Fresno into the city search bar.

If someone wanted to see all UFOs described as a circle they would type circle into the shape search bar.

## Summary:  
The data needs to be further cleaned.  The greatest drawback of the page is the data itself before even getting to the point of becoming a webpage it should have been looked over and cleaned up.  My recommendations are that the data is cleaned and the table is formatted to a much more readable and appealing format.
